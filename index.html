                        Johannes Vermeer

                         Johannes Vermeer was a Dutch Baroque Period painter who specialized 
                         in domestic interior scenes of middle-class life. During his lifetime,
                         he was a moderately successful provincial genre painter, recognized in 
                         Delft and The Hague. Nonetheless, he produced relatively few paintings
                         and evidently was not wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death.
                         
                    <p>
                        Vermeer worked slowly and with great care, and frequently used very expensive pigments.
                         He is particularly renowned for his masterly treatment and use of light in his work.
                         "Almost all his paintings", Hans Koningsberger wrote, "are apparently set in two smallish
                          rooms in his house in Delft; they show the same furniture and decorations in various arrangements
                           and they often portray the same people, mostly women."
                    <p>
                         His modest celebrity gave way to obscurity after his death. He was barely mentioned in 
                         Arnold Houbraken's major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting and was thus omitted 
                         from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries.

                            Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most 
                            famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks,
                             including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include
                              landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic,
                               impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.

                            Not commercially successful, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, eventually leading to his
                            suicide at age thirty-seven.Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious,
                            quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed after
                            he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium.
                            He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents.
                            His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept a long correspondence by letter.
